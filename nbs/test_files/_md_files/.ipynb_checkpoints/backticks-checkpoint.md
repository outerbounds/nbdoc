Hey I am going to see what happens when we have things like [@conda](https://outerbounds.github.io/nbdoc/decorators) and [@batch](https://outerbounds.github.io/nbdoc/decorators), but you will not convert conda to a link because it isn't in back ticks.

If something isn't in the index like `@lorem`, nothing will happen.

```py
In code fences you will not convert links `@conda`
```

# Some other md

this is another test: [function_with_types_in_docstring](https://outerbounds.github.io/nbdoc/test_docs)
